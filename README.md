# robot-manipulation-llm
This implementation allows the Tiago Robot to reason through a fetching task autonomously; by utilising compact LLMs 

## Setup
- Set up a Tiago Docker; supplied by Pal-Robotics for the barebone or ask me for the final docker image. 
- create a catkin workspace **lmt_ws** in the **exchange** directory
- create packages [llm_fetch_me](./llm_fetch_me) and [custom_msg_srv](./custom_msg_srv) and copy the GIT data into it
- install the ollama package on the PC outside the Docker and download 

## Starting the Docker
